# Etch-a-Sketch
This project aims to be like a canvas to draw art. There's still some work to be done to make this all work perfectly.
The biggest challenge was changing the size of the canvas.
The Tools I used where; VS code and chrome, while having done all of this in a Linux environment.

The project can be viewed and tested here: https://emfey.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/
